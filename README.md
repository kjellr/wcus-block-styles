## Overview

This repo houses a demo plugin to show off a handful of artful block styles. These were showcased as part of a presentation called "Creative Use of Block Styles" at [WordCamp US 2021](http://us.wordcamp.org/2021/).

## Block Styles

### 1. Rotate (Image Block)

Endlessly rotates an image.

### 2. Jazz Cover (Image Block)

Applies an image mask and filter to any image block, mimicking a style from Blue Note jazz record covers. Animates on hover.

### 3. Photocopy (Image Block)

Applies a photocopy-like effect to any image.

## 4. Warped (Heading Block)

Applies a stretched, wavy effect to text, reminiscent of the warping that occurs if you move your paper around while photocopying.

### 5. Photocopy Collage (Gallery Block)

Arranges gallery items vertically, and masks each one as if it's on a torn piece of paper.

### 6. Shifted Baseline (Heading Block)

Applies a random(ish) pattern of vertical baseline ajustments to each individual letter in a heading block. The letters resolve back to their default positions on hover.

### 7. Shifted Baseline (Intense) (Heading Block)

Applies a random(ish) pattern of vertical and horizontal baseline ajustments to each individual letter in a heading block. The letters resolve back to their default positions on hover.

## Bugs?

Yes, there are bugs! All of the styles here are just proof-of-concepts. With that in mind, please do feel free to file a bug report (or to provide a fix!). In additon, if you know of a better way to accomplish one of the block styles here, I'd absolutely love to hear about it!
